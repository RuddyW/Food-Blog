<br><br>
**Ingredients:**
<br>
For the Marinated Chicken:<br>
- 1.5 pounds (700g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces<br>
- 1 cup plain yogurt<br>
- 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste (or minced ginger and garlic)<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric<br>
- 1 teaspoon garam masala<br>
- Salt and pepper to taste<br>
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
<br><br>
For the Butter Chicken Sauce:<br>
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
- 2 large onions, finely chopped<br>
- 4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
- 1 teaspoon paprika<br>
- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)<br>
- 1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes<br>
- 1/2 cup heavy cream<br>
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter<br>
- Salt to taste<br>
- Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish
<br><br>
**Instructions:**
<br><br>
**Marinating the Chicken:**
<br>
1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala, salt, and pepper.
<br><br>
2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or ideally overnight, to let the flavors meld.
<br><br>
**Cooking the Chicken:**
<br>
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat.
<br><br>
4. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set it aside.
<br><br>
**Preparing the Butter Chicken Sauce:**
<br>
5. In the same skillet, add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
<br><br>
6. Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.
<br><br>
7. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
<br><br>
8. Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, and chili powder. Sauté for another minute or until the spices release their fragrance.
<br><br>
9. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, or until it thickens and the oil starts to separate from the tomato mixture.
<br><br>
10. Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce and let them simmer together for a few minutes to combine the flavors.
<br><br>
11. Stir in the heavy cream and unsalted butter. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is creamy and the chicken is coated.
<br><br>
12. Season the Butter Chicken with salt to taste, and adjust the spices if needed.
<br><br>
**Serving:**
<br>
13. Serve your homemade Butter Chicken over steamed rice or with warm naan bread.
<br><br>
14. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
<br><br>
15. Enjoy the rich and creamy flavors of Butter Chicken, one of India's most beloved dishes!
