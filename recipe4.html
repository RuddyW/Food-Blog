7. Stir in the chopped bell peppers and cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften.
<br><br>
8. Add the coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala. Mix well to combine the spices with the vegetables.
<br><br>
9. Pour in the tomato puree and cook for a few more minutes until the oil starts to separate from the sauce.
<br><br>
10. Reduce the heat to low, and then add the heavy cream and salt. Stir until the sauce becomes creamy and well incorporated.
<br><br>
11. Return the cooked chicken pieces to the pan, coating them with the sauce. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to heat the chicken through.
<br><br>
12. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
