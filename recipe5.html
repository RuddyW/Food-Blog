    Chicken Alfredo is a creamy and indulgent Italian-American dish that combines tender chicken with a luscious Alfredo sauce. Here's a classic Chicken Alfredo recipe for you to enjoy:<br>

**Ingredients:**
<br><br>
For the Chicken:<br>
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br>
- Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
- 1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or dried basil and oregano)
<br><br>
For the Alfredo Sauce:<br>
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter<br>
- 4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
- 1 cup heavy cream<br>
- 1 cup whole milk<br>
- 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese<br>
- Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
- Pinch of nutmeg (optional, for added flavor)
<br><br>
For the Pasta:<br>
- 12 ounces fettuccine pasta or your preferred pasta
<br><br>
**Instructions:**
<br>
**Cooking the Chicken:**
<br>
1. Season the chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning on both sides.
<br><br>
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken breasts and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until they are fully cooked and have a golden-brown crust. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165°F (74°C). Remove the chicken from the skillet, let it rest for a few minutes, then slice it into thin strips.
<br><br>
**Preparing the Alfredo Sauce:**
<br>
3. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
<br><br>
4. Pour in the heavy cream and whole milk. Stir and simmer for a few minutes until the mixture is heated but not boiling.
<br><br>
5. Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Continue to cook for a few more minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken.
<br><br>
6. Season the sauce with salt, black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg (if using). Adjust the seasonings to your taste.
<br><br>
**Cooking the Pasta:**
<br>
7. While preparing the sauce, cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.
<br><br>
**Combining Chicken, Sauce, and Pasta:**
<br>
8. Add the sliced cooked chicken to the Alfredo sauce and stir to coat the chicken in the creamy sauce. Heat everything together for a few minutes until it's heated through.
<br><br>
9. Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the chicken and sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is well coated in the creamy Alfredo sauce.
<br><br>
**Serving:**
<br>
10. Serve your Chicken Alfredo hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley, if desired.
<br><br>
11. Enjoy your homemade Chicken Alfredo with a side of garlic bread or a crisp salad. 
<br><br>
This creamy and rich Chicken Alfredo is a delightful comfort food that's perfect for a special dinner or whenever you're craving a comforting Italian-American classic.
