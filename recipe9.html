    One-Pan Coconut-Lime Chicken is a flavorful and easy-to-make dish that combines tender chicken with the tropical tastes of coconut and zesty lime. Here's a delicious recipe for you to try:
<br><br>
**Ingredients:**
<br><br>
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs<br>
- Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
- 2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
- 1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
- 3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced<br>
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced<br>
- 1 can (14 ounces) coconut milk<br>
- Zest and juice of 2 limes<br>
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (plus more for garnish)<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)<br>
- Cooked rice or quinoa for serving
<br><br>
**Instructions:**
<br>
1. Season the chicken breasts or thighs with salt and black pepper on both sides.
<br><br>
2. In a large skillet or pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
<br><br>
3. Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set it aside.
<br><br>
4. In the same skillet, add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Saut√© for a couple of minutes until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.
<br><br>
5. Stir in the sliced red and yellow bell peppers and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.
<br><br>
6. Pour in the coconut milk, lime zest, lime juice, fresh cilantro, ground cumin, ground coriander, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine all the ingredients.
<br><br>
7. Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, nestling it into the sauce.
<br><br>
8. Reduce the heat to low and let everything simmer together for about 5-10 minutes to heat the chicken through and allow the flavors to meld.
<br><br>
9. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with more salt, black pepper, or red pepper flakes if desired.
<br><br>
10. Serve your One-Pan Coconut-Lime Chicken over cooked rice or quinoa, spooning the flavorful coconut-lime sauce over the top.
<br><br>
11. Garnish with additional fresh cilantro.
<br><br>
12. Enjoy your tropical-inspired, one-pan meal that's bursting with coconut and lime flavors!
<br><br>
This One-Pan Coconut-Lime Chicken recipe is not only delicious but also quick and convenient to prepare, making it a perfect weeknight dinner option. The combination of creamy coconut milk, zesty lime, and aromatic spices creates a delightful and refreshing meal.
