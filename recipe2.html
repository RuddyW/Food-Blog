    Creamy Pesto Sauce is a delightful addition to pasta, chicken, vegetables, and more. Here's a simple recipe to make this flavorful sauce:<br>

    Ingredients:
    <br>
    1 cup fresh basil leaves, packed<br>
    1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
    1/2 cup pine nuts or walnuts (toasted, if desired)<br>
    3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
    1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
    1/2 cup heavy cream<br>
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
    1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (optional, for extra flavor)<br>
    Red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)<br><br>
    Instructions:<br>
    
    Prepare the Basil: Wash and dry the fresh basil leaves. Remove any large stems, as they can be bitter.
    <br><br>
    Toast the Nuts (optional): If you prefer a toasted flavor, lightly toast the pine nuts or walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until they become fragrant and slightly browned. Be sure to watch them closely, as they can burn quickly. Remove from heat and let them cool.
    <br><br>
    Blend the Pesto: In a food processor, combine the fresh basil, grated Parmesan cheese, toasted nuts (if using), and minced garlic. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped and well combined.
    <br><br>
    Add Olive Oil: While the food processor is running, slowly drizzle in the extra-virgin olive oil until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.
    <br><br>
    Add Cream: Transfer the basil mixture to a saucepan and stir in the heavy cream. Warm the sauce over low heat, stirring constantly, until it's heated through but not boiling.
    <br><br>
    Season: Season the creamy pesto sauce with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if desired). Adjust the seasonings to taste.
    <br><br>
    Optional Pecorino Romano: If you want to add an extra layer of flavor, stir in the grated Pecorino Romano cheese.
    <br><br>
    Serve: Toss the creamy pesto sauce with cooked pasta, grilled chicken, or roasted vegetables. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for bread or as a topping for pizza.
    <br><br>
    Enjoy: Your homemade creamy pesto sauce is ready to elevate your dishes with its rich, basil-infused creaminess.
    <br><br>
    Feel free to adjust the consistency by adding more cream or olive oil as needed. Creamy pesto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days. Enjoy its vibrant flavor in various recipes or as a versatile condiment.
