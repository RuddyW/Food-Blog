    Roast chicken is a classic and comforting dish that's perfect for any occasion. Here's a simple roast chicken recipe that yields tender, flavorful results:<br>

Ingredients:
<br>
- 1 whole chicken (about 4-5 pounds)<br>
- 2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
- 1 lemon, cut in half<br>
- 4-6 garlic cloves, peeled<br>
- A few sprigs of fresh rosemary, thyme, or your favorite herbs<br>
- 1 onion, quartered (optional)<br>
- 2-3 carrots, cut into chunks (optional)<br>
- 2-3 potatoes, cut into chunks (optional)<br>
<br>
**Instructions:**
<br>
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C). Place a rack in the center of the oven.
<br><br>
2. **Prepare the Chicken:** Remove the giblets from the chicken cavity if they are included. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, which will help the skin get crispy. 
<br><br>
3. **Season the Chicken:** Rub the chicken with olive oil, ensuring it's evenly coated. Season the chicken generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper, both inside and outside. 
<br><br>
4. **Stuff the Chicken:** Place the lemon halves, garlic cloves, and fresh herbs inside the chicken cavity. This will infuse the chicken with wonderful flavors as it roasts.
<br><br>
5. **Tie the Legs (Optional):** If you prefer, you can truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine. This helps the chicken cook more evenly.
<br><br>
6. **Prepare the Vegetables (Optional):** If you're using vegetables, place them in the bottom of a roasting pan and drizzle with a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
<br><br>
7. **Roast the Chicken:** Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a rack in the roasting pan. If you didn't use vegetables, you can place the chicken directly in the pan. 
<br><br>
8. **Roast the chicken** in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) in the thickest part of the thigh. Baste the chicken with the pan juices every 20-30 minutes for a moist and flavorful result.
<br><br>
9. **Rest the Chicken:** Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the chicken moist.
<br><br>
10. **Carve and Serve:** Carve the roast chicken into serving pieces and serve it with the roasted vegetables and pan juices.
<br><br>
11. **Enjoy:** Enjoy your homemade roast chicken with all its delicious, savory goodness.
<br><br>
This roast chicken recipe is a versatile dish that you can customize with your favorite herbs and sides. It's perfect for a cozy family dinner or a special occasion meal.
