    Lemony Chicken and Potatoes with Feta is a delightful Mediterranean-inspired dish that combines tender chicken, crispy potatoes, and tangy feta cheese with a zesty lemony flavor. Here's a delicious recipe for you to try:
    <br><br>
**Ingredients:**
<br><br>
For the Chicken and Potatoes:<br>
- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs<br>
- 4-5 medium-sized potatoes, cut into chunks<br>
- 3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
- 4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
- 1 lemon, zest and juice<br>
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
- Salt and black pepper to taste<br>
<br>
For the Feta Topping:<br>
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese<br>
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped<br>
- Lemon wedges for serving<br>
<br>
**Instructions:**
<br><br>
**Marinating the Chicken and Potatoes:**
<br>
1. In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
<br><br>
2. Add the chicken thighs and potato chunks to the bowl, and toss them in the marinade until they are well coated. Allow them to marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.
<br><br>
**Cooking the Chicken and Potatoes:**
<br>
3. Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).
<br><br>
4. Arrange the marinated chicken thighs and potato chunks in a single layer in a baking dish or oven-safe skillet.
<br><br>
5. Drizzle any remaining marinade over the chicken and potatoes.
<br><br>
6. Roast in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through, and the potatoes are crispy and golden brown. Make sure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (74째C).
<br><br>
**Adding the Feta Topping:**
<br>
7. In the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese evenly over the chicken and potatoes. Return the dish to the oven and allow the cheese to melt and become slightly golden.
<br><br>
**Garnishing and Serving:**
<br>
8. Remove the Lemony Chicken and Potatoes with Feta from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley.
<br><br>
9. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for an extra burst of citrus flavor.
<br><br>
10. Enjoy this savory and zesty Mediterranean dish with a satisfying combination of flavors and textures!
<br><br>
This Lemony Chicken and Potatoes with Feta recipe is perfect for a family dinner or a casual gathering with friends. The lemony marinade adds a refreshing brightness to the dish, while the feta cheese provides a creamy and tangy element that complements the tender chicken and crispy potatoes.
